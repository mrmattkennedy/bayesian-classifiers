This is a rework of the first project of my machine learning course from last year. I had poor results and times when I did it initially, so I tried it again with a little more experience. Currently, results are at nearly 90%, with time performance reaching under 17 seconds. I used different sized training sets as well as utilizing stemmers and stop words. Attached is a visualization of the results.
